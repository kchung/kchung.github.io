          <p>On this faithful day, one year ago, I became a full-time employee at <a href="http://www.weebly.com">Weebly</a>. It was hands down one of the best decisions I've made in my life.</p>

<p>The journey started shortly after I graduated from college. I was young and obsessed with startups. I frequented Hacker News while I was working on some contracting work and I ran into a post about Y Combinator's <a href="http://workatastartup.org/">Work at a Startup 2012</a>. I applied since it wasn't too far away from Reno and was accepted.</p>

<p>At the time, I've never experienced a shred silicon valley startup culture. When I showed up to the sketch warehouse in Mountain View for the event, I was decked out in slacks, nice shoes, and a button up. Everyone else was wearing shorts, flip-flops, and the iconic plaid shirt. I was instantly a foreigner.</p>

<p>A bunch of YC companies talked about their startup, there were so many that it was hard to remember what each one did. <i>"We haven't slept in three weeks.."</i>, <i>"It all started on an air mattress.."</i>, <i>"We have a secret room.."</i>, and <i>"Profitable.."</i> are just a few of the quotes I still remember hearing that night.</p>

<p>After the presentations, we were fed burgers and beer. I waddled around and talked to a few founders that I circled in my little notebook. Towards the end of the night and after a few beers, I have to say I felt <i>preetty</i> good.</p>

<p>In my pocket were a bunch of my hand-cut business cards that I thought were cool. They had my website, my contact information, my email address, and a blank face on them. The business card required me to hand-draw a different face for every card I gave out. This night I gave out some pirate faces, smilies with mustaches, and squinty eyes. I got a few good chuckles after giving them out so I thought it was neat.</p>

<p>I ran into David Rusenko, and we talked about our travels in Italy, his company, and my life. Conversation was good but he had to run. I juggled around my beer, a pen, and a card where I proceeded to bend over and draw him a cool guy with some shades B) on my thigh. I was thinking how cool this face was going to end up before realizing I was spilling beer all the place like a drunko.</p>

<p>He laughed it off and I left the event embarrassed. I spent the next day coding at a Starbucks and received an email to come check out the Weebly office from Dave.</p>

<p>I wear plaid to work now.</p>
